# Tageso API v2
This Version of the API is a complete rewrite of the API based on Lumen and MYSQL.

In the first step the API-Interface should be contains a "new" Interface with a lot of Depricated functions. So the changes a the GUI can be really small to make it easy to release the new Version. In the secound step the "Depricated" functions and parameters will be removed after the GUI switch to the new API-Interface.

You can use the hosted Version of Tageso with a [Live-System](https://www.tageso.de/) and a [Stage-System](https://stg.tageso.de/).

# Open Source
This API should become an Open-Source Projekt.
